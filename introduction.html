    <h2>The Need to Share Information</h2>
    <p>The most fundamental truth is that we have information on one computer (Computer A) and we want it to be on another computer (Computer B). These computers are not in the same room.<br>

    How do we solve this? The simplest, most primitive way is to physically carry the information (e.g., on a USB stick). This works, but it's slow and doesn't scale. We need a direct, electronic connection.<br>

    So, we run a cable (like an ethernet cable or a fiber optic line) between Computer A and Computer B. We can now send electrical <br>signals or pulses of light down this cable. We can agree on a simple code: a high-voltage signal means "1," and a low-voltage signal means "0."<br>

    We have just created the most basic form of a network: aÂ **direct link**. We can now send bits (1s and 0s) between two computers.</p>

    <h2>The Problem of Connecting Networks</h2>
    <p>Now, our office has a local network. Another office across town also has its own local network. How does a computer on our network talk to a computer on their network?<br>

We face the same scaling problem. We can't run a wire from every computer in our office to every computer in theirs.<br>

The logical solution is to connect theÂ *networks themselves*. We need a special, dedicated computer that is connected toÂ *our*Â network<br> and also connected toÂ *their*Â network. Its only job is to pass messages, or "route" traffic, from one network to the other. Let's call this device aÂ **Router**.<br>

Now, if we want to connect to a third network, we just connect our router to their router. Suddenly, we can build a massive, sprawling web by connecting networks to other networks.<br>

This is the fundamental truth of the Internet. TheÂ **Internet is a "network of networks."**Â It is not one giant cloud; it is millions of private and public local networks all connected by these special routing devices.<br></p>

<h2>IP Address</h2>
<p>AnÂ IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)Â address is the classic IP address format everyone is used to seeing.<br>
    <ul>
        <li>Structure:Â It's a 32-bit number. To make it readable for humans, we divide it into four 8-bit sections, and write each section as a decimal number from 0 to 255.</li>
        <li>Example:Â 172.217.16.142Â (one of Google's addresses)</li>
        <li>The Big Problem (The Why):Â A 32-bit number means there's a hard limit on the total number of possible addresses: 2^32, which is aboutÂ 4.3 billion.</li>
    </ul>
    When the internet was designed, 4.3 billion seemed like an infinite number.<br> But with the explosion of laptops, phones, servers, smart watches, and even smart refrigerators, we quickly realized we would run out. This scarcity is theÂ single most important reasonÂ we have public and private IPs.

<h2>Public IP Address.</h2>
<p>A Public IP address is yourÂ global, unique address on the internet.</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Analogy:</b>Â The company's main, public phone number.</li>
    <li><b>Uniqueness:</b>Â It must beÂ globally unique. No two devices on the internet can have the same public IP address at the same time.</li>
    <li><b>Purpose:Â </b>To be reachable from anywhere in the world. This is the address that web servers, email servers, and any other public service use.</li>
    <li><b>Assignment:</b>Â It is assigned to you by yourÂ Internet Service Provider (ISP)Â (Comcast, AT&T, etc.). You don't control it; you lease it from them.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Private IP Address.</h2>
<p>A Private IP address is aÂ local address used onlyÂ withinÂ your own private networkÂ (e.g., your home Wi-Fi, your office network).
<ul>
    <li><b>Analogy:Â </b>The employee's private, 4-digit extension number.</li>
    <li><b>Uniqueness:Â </b>It only needs to be uniqueÂ on your local network.<br> My laptop can have the addressÂ 192.168.1.100Â on my home Wi-Fi, and your laptop can have theÂ exact same addressÂ on your home Wi-Fi. <br>They don't conflict because they are in separate, private networks.</li>
    <li><b>Purpose:</b>Â To allow devices on the same local network to communicate with each other without needing a globally unique address for each one. <br>Your laptop talks to your printer using private IPs. Your phone streams to your Chromecast using private IPs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>IPv6</h2>
<p>IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)Â is the next generation of the Internet Protocol.<br> Its primary purpose was to solve the address exhaustion problem of IPv4.

    <h3>The fundamental difference is the size of the address:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>IPv4:</b>Â Uses aÂ 32-bitÂ address, giving us ~4.3 billion unique addresses.</li>
        <li><b>IPv6:</b>Â Uses aÂ 128-bitÂ address.</li>

        The difference between 32-bit and 128-bit is not 4x. It's an exponential leap that is difficult to comprehend.<br>

The number of possible IPv6 addresses is 2^128, which is roughly:<br>

**340,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000**

(340 undecillion)
    </ul>

</p>


</p>

<h2>MAC Address:</h2>
<p>AÂ MAC <b>(Media Access Control)</b> AddressÂ is a unique, permanent serial number burned into<br> every network-capable piece of hardware (your laptop's Wi-Fi card, your phone, your smart TV, the network port on your desktop).

    A MAC address is aÂ 48-bitÂ number. To make it readable for humans, <br>it's typically written asÂ 12 hexadecimal digits.

    <h3>The most common ways you'll see it displayed are:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Colon-Separated (Most Common):<br>3C:22:FB:A3:B4:C5</li>
        <li>Hyphen-Separated (Common on Windows):<br>3C-22-FB-A3-B4-C5</li>
        <li>Period-Separated (Used by Cisco and other network gear):<br>3c22.fba3.b4c5</li>
        <li>No Separators (Less common, seen in some software)<br>3C22FBA3B4C5</li>
    </ol>

<h2>Port Number</h2>
<p>Port numbers areÂ numerical identifiers (0-65535) in computer networking that identify specific applications or services on a device.<br>Â They work with IP addresses to direct network traffic to the correct service on a machine,<br> with common ports assigned to standard applications like HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443).</p>

<b>A port number is aÂ 16-bit unsigned integer.</b>

<h2>What is a VPN?</h2>
<p><b>A Virtual Private Network (VPN)</b> creates an encrypted, private tunnel for your internet connection,<br> masking your IP address and protecting your online activity from being seen by third parties like your Internet Service Provider (ISP) or potential<br> cybercriminals on public networks. VPNs are used to enhance online privacy, secure data transmission,<br> and circumvent geo-restrictions or censorship by allowing you to appear as if you are browsing from the location of the VPN server. </p>
